Here are some ImageJ plugins for estimating fractal dimension from images using box counting methods. 
The following image types are supported: 2D binary (black and white), 2D greyscale (map), 3D (black and white).
The plugins were written by Jens Bache-Wiig and myself and are free software in the public domain.

Java 1.5 or later is required.

To install the plugins: 
 - Compile the Java files with ImageJ(.jar) on the classpath
 - Copy the resulting .class files to the ImageJ plugin folder.
